# RNGScript
It's my first "working" Python script, the main function is to randomly choose given number of option from the list that stays in another file, which is
created on first startup, which allows the list to be kept for whatever things you want RNGesus to decide upon on another day. Also, positions picked up from
the list will not appear twice in the same roll. At least if they are not wrote twice on the list ;). Anyways, result should only give a combination of unique variables.

Options can be added when running the script, as well as manually through editing "list.txt" that should appear in a folder with the script file
after first running. To add things manually, just write another option in next line in the file.

What it does (for now):

1. Create a custom list that keeps all the data you input.
2. A function to choose n number of things to get from your list.
3. Results of the roll may be changed once, but only in a 1 for 2 trade-off.
4. Doesnt exit when roll is done, trying to make it so if you want to, you can try out many combinations without starting up the script again and again.
5. It ain't much, but it's newbie's honest work ^^.
